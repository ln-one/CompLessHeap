# Heap Optimization: Promote Child Then Sink Parent to Reduce Comparisons

## Background

Standard heap construction and adjustment algorithms may require a large number of comparison operations in some cases, especially when the cost of comparison operations is high.

## Problem

Is it possible to reduce the number of comparisons in heap operations by sacrificing a small amount of extra space?

## Proposed Solution

Propose a new heap operation strategy, the core idea of which is as follows:

1.  **Remove Parent:** Temporarily store the value of the non-leaf parent node.
2.  **Promote Child:** "Promote" the larger of the two child nodes of the parent node to the parent node's position.
3.  **Sink into Vacancy:** Put the previously stored parent node value into the original position of the promoted child node, and then perform a sink operation to find a suitable position.

## Potential Advantages

*   Reduce the number of comparisons, especially when the value of the parent node is significantly smaller than most nodes in its subtree.
*   Can bring more significant performance improvements in scenarios where the cost of comparison operations is high.

## Potential Problems

*   Requires extra space to temporarily store the value of the parent node.
*   The complexity of code implementation may increase.
*   May not be suitable for all situations, and needs to be weighed according to the specific situation.

## Discussion

*   Is this optimization strategy feasible?
*   In which scenarios can it bring real performance improvements?
*   Are there better heap optimization methods?
*   How to evaluate the effectiveness of this optimization method?

## Expectations

It is hoped that through discussion, we can gain a deeper understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of this optimization method, and explore its feasibility in practical applications.
